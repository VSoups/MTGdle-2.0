# MTGdle 2.0

A complete overhaul of the original [MTGdle](https://github.com/VSoups/MTGdle). Now made with Node for a seamless front end, as well as Express for tracking global scores and a daily card guess system like the Wordle. An infinite mode will also be available for players who want to keep playing repeatedly and don't want to wait for the next day.

This page will be updated during the development of the new version.
